        <p>Hello my name is Sebastian Quintana and I'm in the web development program, this is my 3rd Quater in Seattle Central and I'm very
  excited about this class because one of my goal in this program is in the future a front end development with an ability to understand more
   than one language also learn a backend language too
 </p>
 <p>I'm original from Valparaiso, Chile and I moved 11 years ago to this beautiful country and city, back when I was in Chile I studied engineer 
 in statistics and back then I took programming classes using a very old language call Pascal. I didn't finish school because after 2 years and a half I moved to here and here we are.
 </p>
 <p>Also, I been married almost 3 years and very happy to have a partner and we really like to travel so we are now focused to finish my school and my wife is a sous chef at Matt's in the market so always is good to go to adventures and try new food and experiences
 </p>
 <p>Just now we came back from Hong Kong and Vietnam and before we were in Chile and Argentina, 2019 was amazing and start also classes here. </p>
