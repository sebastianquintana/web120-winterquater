   <h1>Shopping Carts</h1>
   <p>So the first thing you ask is What is a shopping cart? <br> “ “Shopping cart” is a term that has come to mean one of two things: first, an online ordering system that is separate from an e-commerce website, and second, a store-building system that can be used to build and manage both an e-commerce site's
       web pages and its ordering system. We first describe the feature typically included in all carts-an ordering system. Next, we discuss the additional features included in store-building systems. Finally, we briefly review the shopping cart
       market itself through an examination of the types of systems vendors were offering at the time this paper was written. <a href="”https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J179v05n02_05">www.tanffonine.com </a></p>

<p>“Every online store must have the shopping cart functionality to be able to sell products to customers. Essentially, there are two types of shopping carts – hosted and self-hosted shopping carts.
   <br><br>

   <b>Hosted shopping carts</b> are off-the-shelf solutions managed by the company who created them. What this means is that all you need to do to set up your store is to sign up with your chosen host and you’re good to go. You can use pre-made website templates to set up a completely new store or simply add 
   purchase buttons to your existing website and start selling immediately. By far the most popular hosted shopping cart is Shopify, but there are plenty of other options, too.<br>
   <b>Self-hosted shopping carts</b> are 100% customizable shopping solutions that you host on your own server. This simply means that you
    download the software and run it yourself.” by <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/shopping-cart.">www.oberlo.com</a></p>
