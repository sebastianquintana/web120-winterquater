<h1>Responsive vs Mobile.</h1>
 <p>So in theory responsive or mobile website is just like any other – it uses HTML pages that can be accessed with any browser. However, while a usual website is built for viewing on a desktop, first of all, a mobile site is specially designed to appear on smaller screens like mobile phones and tablets.

   The responsive mobile design generally means that your site is designed specifically for mobile use. It will often be housed under a different URL (usually something like m.yoursite.com) and will feature subsets of your desktop content that are appropriate for mobile viewing. These pages will adapt to whatever screen size the user desires.

      <p>“Back in 2010, Ethan Marcotte urged designers and developers to practice “responsive web design” (RWD):
         “Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web devices, we can treat them as facets of the same experience. We can [make our] designs […] more adaptive to the media that renders them. By designing websites that adapt to any device, designers and developers could future-proof their work, he argued.”by inVinsion. For more click next link.
