<h2><b>What is FlexBox?</b></h2>
<div>
<p>Flexbox is a part of CSS that provides a more efficient way to layout, align and distribute space among items in a container. 
   It helps us when we have those silly block elements, that even with display: inline-block, it can be hard to do just what we want them to do.
</p>
<p>“As we start working with Flexbox, a very important distinction should be pointed out. We need to be careful about the CSS rules we apply to a parent element vs. those to a child element. A parent element wraps other elements, a child is nested inside the parent.” by frontend.turing.io .
   If you want to learn more about parent and child and how important is flexbox here is the link. <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/intro-to-flexbox.html?ads_cmpid=6451354298&ads_adid=76255849919&ads_matchtype=b&ads_network=g&ads_creative=378026856672&utm_term=&ads_targetid=dsa-411254066377&utm_campaign=&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&ttv=2&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-bjyBRCcARIsAFboWg3xcbSFeDn0zkD2dwmXdRbD-lDEVNmaGsaOEbzdbpQYojPKaJJ_hG8aAlC3EALw_wcB">www.frontend.turing.io </a>

<p>Also how important is be sure if the browser can support the new code because sometimes there are browser can’t support new element and if you want to make sure if your code is able to run in the browser of your client demand make sure to check and ask in what platform they gonna work.
   Here is a link to check what browser support flexbox in 2020. <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">www.caniuse.com</a>
   </p>
<p>There is an element can help you if the browser can’t support the flexbox or other code shims, fallbacks, and polyfills in order to implant HTML5 functionality in browsers that don't natively support them, I trying to learn more about this but all the resource I founded there are from 2013-2016 and I feel that is a little old for coding because this is moving very fast .
   There is talk about what is the difference between flexbox and CSS grid now we are  focus on those  particular coding ways.
   “Dimensions define the primary demarcation between Flexbox and CSS Grid. Flexbox was designed specifically for one-dimensional layouts, while CSS Grid is engineered to enable two-dimensional layouts. Therefore, CSS Grid can easily render rows and columns simultaneously.” by Shaira Williams
